# Lesson 5: From Theory to Practice

## Overview

This final lesson will tie together open access software development with the operation of a software management plan (SMP). You'll be introduced to the community aspect of open software, beginning with a discussion on writing software management plans, then learning how to connect with open software communities. This will also be contextualized by the benefits of a software community and the roles involved in these groups. After being presented with a list of communities, you will be asked to explore and engage with some of them. Finally, this lesson will wrap up with additional resources and helpful suggestions for contributing to open software.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Recall the definition of a software management plan, potentially as part of an Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP), and where to find helpful resources.
- List ways to engage with and contribute to open software communities.

## Open Science and Data Management Plans

<QuoteImage quote='A NASA Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP) describes how the scientific information that will be produced from NASA-funded scientific activities will be managed and made openly available. The OSDMP should include sections on data management, software management, and publication sharing.' byWho="https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/" byWhoLink="https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/" bgImage="./images/clone/Module_4/new/codebg.jpg" />

Example sections to include in an OSDMP:

- Data management plan (DMP)
- Software management plan (SMP)
- Publication sharing
- Other open science activities
- Roles and responsibilities

#### Recall the steps for an SMP from the previous lessons:

## How Do We Plan for Making Our Code Open?

### Should a Software or Data Management Plan be Written?

If you are planning a project that may require a software/data management plan, writing that plan is a great first step before beginning the project. However, there are several factors to consider before jumping right into a software/data management plan. "Software" here means scientifically or technically relevant computer programs as both source code and executable software. Below is a list of reasons why you should or shouldn't write an SMP:

<MultiSlider infinite={false}>
  <SliderItem type="multi">
    <h3>SMP is required</h3>
    <p>You need an SMP to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Propose for funding (e.g. NASA, NSF, and likely everywhere soon)</li>
      <li>Collaborate on a team that intends to release code to the public</li>
      <li>Successfully manage any large mission or project</li>
    </ul> 
  </SliderItem>
  <SliderItem type="multi">
    <h3>SMP is not required</h3>
    <p>You probably don't need an SMP if you are working on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A paper by yourself (or with a very small group of collaborators)</li>
      <li>The initial exploration of ideas or experimentation with analysis code</li>
      <li>Education-focused activities</li>
    </ul>
  </SliderItem>
</MultiSlider>

Perhaps your project does not fit into these categories. For example, if your aim is for your results to be reproduced by others, then writing an SMP will be at your discretion.

The following material assumes that you have met the threshold and are writing a data/software management plan.

### Pen to Paper: Getting Started Writing a Plan

If you are applying for funding, it is almost guaranteed that there will be specific data management requirements detailed in the funding opportunity. For example, the funder may require a certain license or use of a specific repository. Make sure to cross-reference your plan with these requirements!

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Examples of Software Management Plans'>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans">software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/national-guidelines-for-software-management-plans/">esciencecenter.nl/national-guidelines-for-software-management-plans/</a></li>

    </ul>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Requirements'>
    <p>What are the requirements to address in an SMP? What does your funding agency or institution say to do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What data formats must be used?</li>
      <li>What are the data/code archival/preservation requirements? </li>
      <li>What roles and responsibilities are necessary to meet all requirements?</li>
    </ul>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

### Funding Agencies

Scientific funding agencies generally solicit peer reviews to support funding decisions. These reviews explicitly or implicitly evaluate related open software. Community participation is necessary to arrive at consensus regarding community standards for funding.

For example: The NASA Science Mission Directorate's (SMD) [SPD-41a](https://science.nasa.gov/spd-41) policy applies to all SMD-funded scientific activities and explicitly states that "funded software should follow best practices in the relevant open source and research communities."

### Established Open Software Policies of Professional Societies

Professional societies such as AAAS, AGU, AAS, and more, influence funding agency policies and directly impact the policies surrounding software used to generate publications. It is important to engage with the community via consensus papers and professional societies in order to guide policy decisions regarding open source software in science.

Science/AAAS explicitly states: "In general, all computer code central to the findings being reported should be available to readers to ensure reproducibility."

### Institutions

The individual institutions we work with impose highly-variable restrictions on open source software due to security, privacy, intellectual property, commercial, or other concerns that do not necessarily align with the ethos of open science. It is important to engage with the institutional community to facilitate the movement toward policies that facilitate open source software as a foundation of open science.

### Activity 5.1: Writing an SMP

In this activity, review the SMP below and think about these questions as you read: 

- What kinds of software does the SMP describe?
- When will the work be shared? 
- Where will the work be shared?
- How will the work be shared so it is a citable artifact?
- Who will be responsible for different aspects of the software? 
- What are some of the limitations of the software?
- How would lacking a plan impact code development years down the line?
- Are results reproducible without the original Interactive Data Language (IDL) code?
- Are there things in the example plan that you would add or be more specific about?

#### Example Software Management Plan

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='1. Expected Software Types'>
    <p>We will use established simulation models to conduct initial simulations for this work. These simulation models are written in Fortran and developed over the last decade. While not publicly available, they are available for the project to use (i.e.via private communication). The simulation models will lead to the generation of output files as described in the Data Management Plan (DMP). We will develop analysis software in Python to analyze the model output files, which will enable the development of derived data products, maps, and figures. Development of the Python analysis software will be shared on a GitHub repository.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='2. Development of Analysis Software'>
    <p>All new development of Python code will be conducted openly on GitHub by members of this project. We will post and follow the established Code of Conduct for software development for our research project, which includes guidelines for contributions by additional members of the scientific community.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='3. Repositories and Timeline for Sharing Software'>
    <p>This work will support the development of two peer-reviewed journal articles. All source code developed in Python to support each article will be archived on Zenodo no later than the article's publication date. The software will be made available under a permissive Apache License 2.0. Zenodo will assign a DOI to the archived software when it is archived.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='4. Software Sharing Exemptions'>
    <p>This work does not support further development of the existing Fortran simulation models, which are maintained independently. We do not have permission to publicly share the Fortran source code for the simulation models.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='5. Roles and Responsibilities'>
    <p>Initial simulation modeling and the development of Python analysis software will be completed by PhD students and postdocs. The Principle Investigator (PI) of this project holds overall responsibility for the execution of this plan.</p>
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

## Engage and Build Open Software Communities

Open software communities are social learning spaces where individuals come together to learn a new skill, exchange knowledge and experiences, and then apply what they've learned from the community in their day-to-day work.

#### Communities offer:

- A low entry point for learning and improving your use of software in research.
- An opportunity to share individual experiences, identify common hurdles, and iteratively enhance knowledge and resolve problems.
- A way to build the collboration around open source software in science and a great way to keep updated on the latest tools and practices.
- A non-hierarchical community of practice where all members of the open software community contribute.

### Connect with Communities

Here are some communities that can help you get started:

- [PyData](https://pydata.org/)
- [SPEC](https://scientific-python.org/specs/)
- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)
- [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/)
- [PyHC](https://heliopython.org/)
- [Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/)
- [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/)
- [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/)
- [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/)
- [WoCCode](https://woccode.github.io/)
- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
- [ObsPy](https://discourse.obspy.org/)
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/new-community.html)

Subscribe to and/or participate in forums (e.g. GitHub discussions, Stack Overflow, or discipline/software-specific), in-person workshops, conferences, and hackathons related to your discipline or software you contribute to. Connecting on social media is also a great way to participate in these communities. Last but not least, talk with your colleagues! They may be able to connect you to a larger community as well.

### Activity 5.2: Browse Through Some of the Communities of Practice

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_4/new/lightbulb.png" />

- Find and browse through the websites associated with two communities of practice listed on the previous section, "Connect with Communities."
- Identify at least two points of entry for engagement, such as an upcoming event (virtual or in person), forums, etc.

#### Key takeaways: browse through some of the communities of practice

- There are many opportunities to engage with communities working on open software.
- Engaging with open software communities can enrich and improve your software.

## Contribute to Open-Source Software

Contributing to open software provides many advantages and opens doors to a number of rewarding opportunities. There are few other industries that can boast the massive number of global contributions like the open source community can. Contributing to open source software is a great way to improve your coding skills and to document your work while growing your community.

There are several types of contributing to open software. Not all of them require writing actual code:

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Add New Features'>
    <p>The most obvious case for contributing to open software is enhancing its usability by adding new features.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Fix Bugs'>
    <p>Alternatively, you can reply to an already opened issue by fixing it.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Report Issues and Make Suggestions About Improving Code'>
    <p>Reporting an issue is a valuable contribution, even if you don't know how to fix it. For example, you might be using a different browser in which the software has not been tested yet, have discovered a particularly uninformative error message, or be unable to feed a valuable user experience back to the developers that can help to improve the overall usability of the software.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Improving and Contributing to Documentation'>
    <p>Contributing to documentation constitutes a great starting point for contributing to open source software and is often overlooked in its importance. Writing documentation allows you to familiarize yourself with the use of the software while helping to teach others.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Create Tutorials, Use Cases, or Visuals'>
    <p>Another way to contribute is to make your experience and use of the software publicly available. For example, you could create a tutorial based on your use of the software, summarize a use case, or provide a summary of your use in a graphic. This part of contribution is particularly appealing as it does not create much extra work to just publish what you have used the software for.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Improve Layout, Automatization, Structure of Code'>
    <p>Apart from creating new code, a good way to contribute to open source software can also be to improve, restructure, or automatize existing code. This is called refactoring and helps to make the software project more effective and stable.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Organize and Attend a Community Meet-Up'>
    <p>Another way to contribute to open source software is via community building. Many software products and toolboxes have a lively community of users that meet on a regular basis in person and online to discuss and improve the software and its use. Participating, or even organizing, such a meetup can be a good way to improve your knowledge of the software, get to know its community, and contribute to open-source projects.</p>
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Code Review'>
    <p>Requests to integrate new contributions into the main code base usually require a review of the contribution by at least one other user. Similar to peer review, code review entails writing a short summary about the quality of the code and making suggestions about improvements.</p>
  </Definition>
