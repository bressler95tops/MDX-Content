## About This Module

Welcome to this introductory module on open science. For the purposes of this course, open science [is defined](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001562) as "a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding" (Ramachandran et al., 2021). In this module, you will take a closer look at what open science is, the current landscape, as well as the benefits and challenges. You will then get a glimpse into the practice of open science, including a case study. To start your journey with open science, you will be presented with actions that you can take starting today, such as exploring scientific communities that you can engage with.

### Target Audience

This module is for anyone who is interested in open science and would like to learn the benefits and ways to get started today.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Explain what open science is, why it's a good thing to do, and list some of the benefits and challenges of open science adoption.
- Describe the practice of open science, including considerations when writing a management plan and the tasks in the "Use, Make, Share" framework.
- Evaluate available options when determining whether research products should or should not be open.
- List ways to connect with others who are part of the open science community.

    <Definition title='Citizen Science, Community Science, and Participatory Science'>
        <p>Terms used to describe projects where members of the public participate in the scientific process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Citizen Science</strong> is <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section3724&num=0&edition=prelim">defined by law</a> as "a form of open collaboration in which individuals or organizations participate voluntarily in the scientific process in various ways". Below is additional information regarding NASA's Citizen Science efforts:
                <ul>
                    <li>NASA <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SPD_33_Citizen_Science_TAGGED.pdf">defines citizen science projects</a> as science projects that rely on volunteers.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/citizen-science/">NASA's citizen science projects</a> are held to the same rigorous standards as any NASA science project.</li>
                    <li>This important ethical practice respects volunteers by helping ensure that their work will result in real contributions to scienceâ€”ideally published in the scientific literature. You can <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/citizen-science/resources/">learn more here</a> about leading a NASA citizen science project.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://calacademy.org/Community-science"><strong>Community Science</strong></a> may include projects with or without professional scientists involved.</li>
            <li><a href="https://serc.si.edu/why-do-we-call-it-participatory-science"><strong>Participatory Science</strong></a>  is another term that avoids using the word "citizen" to lessen confusion and increase collaboration, since participation in citizen science and community science projects generally does not require citizenship in any particular country.</li>
        </ul>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Open Research'>
        <p>How research is performed and how knowledge is shared based on the principle that research should be as open as possible. Learn more <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/open-research/">here.</a></p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Open Scholarship'>

    </Definition>
    <Definition title='FAIR principles'>
        <p>Principles to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasize machine actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.</p>
