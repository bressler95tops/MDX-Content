# Lesson 1: What is Open Science?

## Overview

In this lesson, you take a closer look at what open science means, including the intended goals and outcomes of adopting open science as an individual and as part of a larger community. You then review examples of open science in action. Finally, you wrap up the lesson by taking a closer look at why adopting open science is needed.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain the motivation to do open science and the goals of open science.
- Define open science.
- List different groups that practice open science.

## Motivation for Open Science

Welcome to the first module of NASA's Open Science 101 curriculum! Module 1 has five lessons that present information about the Ethos of Open Science. This incorporates the motivations and best practices for making science more open. This course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA Open Science team, open science Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and a community of contributors (3100+)!

We are really glad you are here!

This is the first lesson in the module on the Ethos of Open Science. Let's begin by explaining the word "ethos".

<QuoteImage quote="Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group, or institution." byWho="Merriam-Webster" bgImage="./images/clone/Module_1/merriamwebster.jpg" />

This lesson describes and showcases what makes open science, as an approach to knowledge production, unique or distinguishable from other scientific approaches.

Note that "ethos" is not exactly "ethics", but offers a broad enough term to include the moral attitudes held by the individuals or institutions who practice open science. To clarify the moral element to this discussion, we speak of "responsible open science" going forward.

The lesson introduces the concept of open science as a whole by explaining its motivation, definition, and operation. The lesson then reviews different components of science and the pillars that make them up. Throughout this module, we have integrated ethics around open science that dictate how you share, give due credit, and work together. These ethical principles encourage you to "Practice the Golden Rule" by treating others the way you would like to be treated in their situation.

The curriculum of this course builds upon the work of others from across the globe and fields of research who paved the way to open science. Their recognition of open science as a necessary tool to share knowledge and catalyze research inspired NASA’s own pursuit to contribute. Best practices, performance indicators, and core principles established by the global open science community inform our current approach.

### Open Science at NASA

NASA funds some of the most diverse research of any federal agency and has a history of sharing research and results going back to the early space science missions in the 1960s. NASA's Open Science 101 curriculum shares guidelines and best practices for open science that are applicable and beneficial across its entire range of research efforts.

NASA funds a variety of research activities, from basic science to applied engineering. NASA datasets cover a range of topics including biology, chemistry, environmental science, geology, and other fields related to robotic and human planetary exploration, stellar evolution, and the search for extraterrestrial life.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image238.png"/>

The open science practices and principles that play a critical role supporting NASA mission success are equally relevant to other government agencies and institutions. Similar considerations, approaches, and behaviors are needed in a variety of scientific contexts. Tools for open science frameworks and workflows follow generally similar models.

Open science practices and principles can be applied to all stages of the research process. One early example of NASA's efforts to involve more people in science is the [exoplanet citizen science projects](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/citizen-science/), with the [Exoplanet Explorers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers) being a significant part of this effort.

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image266.jpg"/>

"Stargazing Live", a live television program, took place across three consecutive nights in 2017. The hosts invited viewers to identify exoplanets in an open access dataset. Within 48 hours of the program's debut, more than 10,000 people had participated in [Exoplanet Explorers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers) and classified over 2 million systems.

Following the first night of the program, the researchers watched the results roll in, as citizen scientists helped sift through the data. On the second night, enough people had participated that the researchers were able to share that 44 Jupiter-size candidate planets, 72 Neptune-size candidate planets, 53 sub-Neptune size candidate planets (larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune), and 44 Earth-size candidate planets had already been found and were undergoing additional analysis.

Communities, working together on a problem, can rapidly find new results! Open science enables this and more.

### The Internet Facilitates Sharing of Information

Historically, factors like time, access to sufficient tools and data, and physical proximity limited who could be involved in science, as well as how easily collaboration could take place within the scientific community. More recently, digital resources like the Internet have increased participation by eliminating barriers to entry and presenting a platform for digital collaboration on a global scale. The internet offered people access to the appropriate infrastructure to conduct open science, while the practices of open science enabled more people to engage with research products. Unfortunately, challenges remain for people who don't have the right computational tools and/or speak the relevant languages.

The Internet creates many outlets for public hosting and free access to research and data. These outlets combined with advances in computational power enable nearly anyone to perform complex data analysis. It is now possible to connect participants, stakeholders, and outputs of open science on the Internet to make scientific processes and products easier to discover and access.

### Why Should We Do Open Science Now?

Science and science communication increasingly face severe pushback from the public because of inadequacies in the reproducibility and replicability of results and the spread of misinformation that fosters mistrust. The practice of open science counteracts this by involving community feedback to validate results in a more robust manner and combats misinformation by making results available to the public.

**Reproduce Results**

Science becomes more robust and accurate when scientists validate their colleagues' results. However, the rapidly-growing pool of published research presents an overwhelming challenge to reproduce:

Source: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115)

- In 2011, the AAAS, publisher of Science, began requiring the authors of computational research reports to share data and software upon request
- In 2018, a [research study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115) was carried out that investigated 204 articles for reproducibility. All of the articles examined were originally published in the journal Science between 2011 and 2018. It was found that only 26% of the papers were able to be reproduced, with the two primary reasons being the inability to get access to the data and software and the fact that the methods were not described in sufficient detail.

**How many studies were reproduced?**

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image600.png"/>

**Open Results Enable Iteration and Improve Error-Detection**

In this section, we will look at an [example](https://undsci.berkeley.edu/cold-fusion-a-case-study-for-scientific-behavior/) of how closed science can restrict research impact and understand how science functions to inform a field’s state of research, the decisions of policymakers, and the actions of society. 

Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann were electrochemists at the University of Utah who collaborated on a cold fusion research project in the 1980’s. The team built a “fusion cell”, consisting of a palladium rod and a platinum rod submerged in heavy water. Heavy water consists of a water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecule in which the hydrogen atoms have been replaced with deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen.  Deuterium contains one neutron, one proton, and one electron; elemental hydrogen contains only a proton and electron. Pons and Fleischmann theorized that if they caused the heavy water molecules to split by employing an electrolysis process, the released deuterium would be absorbed into the palladium rods, the deuterium atoms would fuse together, and a tremendous amount of energy, in the form of heat, would be released. The experiment was conducted, and the team measured the heat produced to be a magnitude of 100 times more than could be attributed to typical chemical processes. Excited by the potential of discovering an inexpensive and accessible source of energy, Pons and Fleischmann sought additional funding to continue their research. With promising results in hand, they applied for government grants.

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_1/cold-fusion-example-v4.png"/>

One reviewer, a nuclear physicist named Steven Jones who was also working on cold fusion, suggested the possibility of a collaboration between their two teams. However, Pons and Fleischmann, believing their experiment to be the key to unlocking cold fusion, declined the offer, unintentionally creating an unofficial race between the two groups to be the first to publish their findings. Encouraged and supported by their institutions to publish rapidly in fear of being scooped, the scientists bypassed the traditional standards of scientific conduct, and did not sufficiently expose their ideas to testing and analysis. Pons and Fleischman, orchestrated by their institution, organized a press conference to announce the success of their cold fusion experiment. The press conference was hosted prior to the publication of their paper, which would have allowed other scientists to evaluate and replicate their results and establish greater creditability for the experiment. The details of their experiment were kept vague, leaving other researchers in the dark about crucial elements of their design.

Unauthorized copies of their paper began to circulate within the scientific community and attempts to replicate the experiment all resulted in failure. Scientists quickly realized that the paper lacked key information necessary for replication. Over time, few groups found any support for the cold fusion hypothesis, and the results from those who did were inconsistent and unreliable. Pons and Fleischmann’s lack of reproducibility indicated that the process for cold fusion had most likely not been discovered.

The scientific community norms in place at the time did not include the open sharing of data and software. This was, in part, because it allowed researchers to keep a competitive advantage when seeking funding opportunities. The practice of withholding code, data, and other research products can stifle scientific progress. In the cold fusion example, a flawed study could have swiftly been corrected by peer feedback, but instead, this “discovery” undermined the credibility of the scientific community. Their failure to be transparent with their findings cost taxpayers upwards of $100 million and dealt a significant blow to the public’s trust in scientific research. It is imperative to shift the entire science ecosystem, policies, and rewards towards the prioritization of openness if the full and immediate benefits of research are to be realized.

**Traditional Publishing Limits Participation**

Historically, scientific publishers have charged subscription fees to access journals and, often, article processing charges (APCs) to cover the costs of preparing a manuscript for press (even when the peer reviewers were volunteering their time). These practices limit both who can read papers and who can publish results.

Open access publishing has significantly increased the number of articles that are available as electronic copies online. A growing number of governments and funding agencies are starting to mandate that research funded by taxpayers must be made available to the public after publication. However, the current hybrid system still does a poor job of allocating costs fairly across the research publication process (more on this in Module 5).

The issue of who has access to published papers also motivates open science. [For example](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/can-science-be-more-equitable-so-everyone-enjoys-benefits-open-science-answer) and as shown below in the charts, even though more climate research is made available as open access than that from other scientific fields, the majority of research articles, including many important ones, remain behind paywalls. Misinformation is freely available to anyone online but scientific results are mostly hidden from the public behind paywalls. This practice does not increase trust in science.

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_1/publications_behind_paywalls.png"/>

## What is Open Science?

But what is open science exactly? Various definitions for open science exist and are in use by different organizations, but all have a central theme.  For the purposes of this course, we will use a definition for open science that was developed in 2021 by scientists working for the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/).

<QuoteImage quote="Open science is a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding." byWho="Ramachandran, R., Bugbee, K., & Murphy, K. (2021). From Open Data To Open Science. Earth and Space Science, 8, e2020EA001562. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001562" byWhoLink="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001562" bgImage="./images/clone/Module_1/telescope.jpg" />

This definition was derived after reviewing numerous open science definitions from agencies, institutions, and organizations around the world. Many of the existing definitions had changed over time as the understanding of open science matured and became more nuanced. Let’s break down the definition a bit more:

- Research products and processes should be available to all, not just a small subset of experts, particularly if funded with public funds.
- Collaboration is the heart of open science. Researchers with different areas of expertise and backgrounds can bring new perspectives and strategies to the project.
- Advancing technology has changed the way we share results.  These advances can be harnessed to enable greater collaboration, increase distribution and exposure for the research products, and accelerate the pace of new discoveries.  
- While open science is our aim, security and privacy remain important concerns. Therefore, select sensitive information should be protected.

Open science is a culture intended to promote science and its social impact. Open science creates new opportunities for different stakeholders including researchers, political decision makers, and public participants. Open science increases study transparency, repeatability, reproducibility, and confirmation. We expand what these terms mean and why they matter throughout this module and later in the Open Science 101 modules.

### How Do You Do Open Science?

The Ethos of Open Science is a broad term that encompasses the moral and ethical attitudes held by individuals and institutions about practicing 'open' science. There is an ethical element to sharing both new knowledge and the processes used to obtain said knowledge. It is important to note that there is no singular way of practicing or conducting open science.

Differing practices, assumptions, and goals are just part of the complexity of open science. There are also divergent moral principles that guide open science communities. Such principles are captured in "codes of conduct". A code of conduct is a community governance mechanism that outlines the principles and practices expected of a given research community’s members, as well as the process for investigating and reprimanding those in violation of the code.

In a sense, a code of conduct constitutes the moral backbone of a research community. However, as with the numerous schools of thought, there are similarly many codes of conduct. In other words, there is no one set of universal principles that all open science
practitioners abide by. For example, consider how [OLS](https://openlifesci.org/code-of-conduct), [INOSC](https://osf.io/6gsye), [allea](https://allea.org/portfolio-item/the-european-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity-2/), [AGU](https://www.agu.org/Plan-for-a-Meeting/AGUMeetings/Meetings-Resources/Meetings-code-of-conduct) and [Ethical Source](https://ethicalsource.dev/governance/code-of-conduct/) all have different codes of conducts and guiding principles.

The goal of NASA's Open Science 101 is to push the community as a whole towards open science as an ethical responsibility to share knowledge.

<Definitions>
  <Definition title='Ethics'>
    Community consensus about "proper" behavior.
  </Definition>
  <Definition title='Morals'>
    Personal set of standards for "good" behavior.
  </Definition>
</Definitions>

You may or may not have heard the term "open science" used before this course. If you have, you likely have some preconception of open science and what it looks like in practice. Let’s collectively look at those various preconceptions.

### Activity 1.1: Think About the What and How of Open Science

In this activity, reflect on your answers to the questions and then compare your thoughts to the key takeaways.

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/lightbulb.png"/>

- What does the act of open science look like? Does a scientist use or create something specific that would characterize their research as open? What comes to your mind?
- Describe how you currently share your materials (data, code, results)?
- How might you share materials in the future more openly?
- What stands in the way?

**Key Takeaways:**

There are many ways to do open science. One of the best ways to start your open science journey is to think about how you do your science and how you might be able to make your science more open.

**Goals of Open Science**

The nuances of implementing open science take time and experience to develop. This curriculum provides practical steps and insightful examples to make open science happen.

Goals of open science include: 
- Facilitating collective benefit.
- Expediting development and innovation.
- Realizing unbiased outcomes.
- Ensuring appropriate control over the data you use, make, or share throughout your research process, and comply with policy, regulatory, and legal guidance on release.
- Nurturing respectful relationships with the external communities who might provide or interact with your data, software, and results.
- Actively engaging with interested scientific and public communities to increase collabortation and consultation throughout your research efforts. Members of communities that provide data must be allowed to determine the benefits, harms, and potential future uses based on their own values and priorities.

### Fostering Collaborations and Reproducibility

<SingleFigure size='small' src="./images/clone/Module_1/image256.png"/>

Openly using, making, and sharing research analyses, software, or datasets gives everyone credit for their work.

Sharing is grounded in the belief that access to information and the ability to collaborate is essential for advancing scientific understanding and solving complex problems.

Open sharing enables greater transparency in the scientific process and facilitates reproducibility; it enables collaboration and includes additional perspectives and expertise; and it makes scientific knowledge more openly available to the public.

Not only does open sharing help society, but it also can benefit each of us as individual researchers. It can lead to greater visibility, impact, and credit of our results, data, and software; it can provide access to new collaborations and ideas, and it can fulfill ethical and social responsibilities.

### Examples of Open Science in Action

        <p>The camera's original purpose wasn't to perform science, only observe. However, access was given to citizen scientists who processed pictures by stitching JunoCam image bands together. Participation among the citizen science community helped expand the utility of the camera and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/europa-clipper/citizen-scientists-enhance-new-europa-images-from-nasas-juno/">led to an unforeseen success</a>. Iconic images created by these citizen scientists of Jupiter and Europa have intrigued and inspired people from across the globe.</p>
        <p>Collected data also benefited traditional science:</p>
        <p>"Pretty much all of what we are learning about the structures and dynamics of Jupiter's clouds is coming from publicly-edited images," says planetary scientist and JunoCam wrangler Candice Hansen.

    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title="EXAMPLE 2 : RADAR DATA TO OBSERVE BIRD MIGRATION ROUTE CHANGES DUE TO WEATHER PATTERNS">
        <p>Have you ever seen weather forecast images for your location? That data comes from NEXRAD radar stations, many of which have been operating for over 30 years. The data has always been made publicly available, but can be difficult to use. It was mostly used for rain information, so stations didn’t see a need to make it readily accessible after 24 hours. Users who wanted the historical data from NEXRAD had to work through the following arduous steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to a website.</li>
            <li>Make a request (but not one too large).</li>
            <li>Wait for a robot to read the data off tape storage and copy it online.</li>
            <li>Receive an email with instructions on where to download a user's data.</li>
            <li>Download the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The massive size of the dataset, more than 250TB, made it essentially impossible to do large-scale analysis. Nobody had the time to make these requests and download the data bit by bit.</p>
        <p><strong>However, in 2015, all NEXRAD data were moved to and made freely available in the cloud. Usage of the dataset increased almost immediately!</strong></p>
        <p>Researchers started using the NEXRAD data for other types of science. For example, they used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/the-birds-in-the-cloud-how-the-university-of-oklahoma-uses-nexrad-data-to-study-birds/">NEXRAD radar readings of birds to monitor flight patterns.</a> In particular, purple martins! Purple martins form huge roosts of up to 50,000 birds that can be tracked using radar. The purple martins perform stunning aerial performances that can now be tracked with the same technology previously reserved for rain measurements.</p>
        <p>In another example of new NEXRAD uses, a NASA-led study linked variability in <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3201/climate-patterns-thousands-of-miles-away-affect-us-bird-migration/?s2=P1382021636_1683417608248277265">bird migration to large-scale weather and climate patterns that originate thousands of miles away</a>. The better land managers understand current migration patterns and foresee behavioral changes in these birds due to short-term weather and climate pattern changes, the better they can direct their conservation and habitat restoration efforts. The newly accessible radar data provides valuable insight needed to achieve their goals. This study was funded by NASA, uses NOAA NEXRAD data, and made fully available for the first time by the AWS Public data program.</p>
        <p>The science of the future makes data so easy to use that it allows new questions to be asked, and answered, quickly to benefit society and policy.</p>

### Key Takeaways: Deﬁnition of Open Science

Open science is multi-faceted and can mean different things to different people. Some scientists may think of open science as open access publications or as citizen science. In this module and more broadly in this curriculum, we make it clear that open science encompasses all of these various aspects. Right now, you may be more comfortable with some aspects of open science than others - and that’s ok! We hope that you will better understand the scope and nuances of open science by the end of this curriculum, and also understand the benefits of doing open science, as we have begun to discuss in this section. Specifically, the increasing amount of information about scientific processes and products available online enables access for a much wider array of individuals and communities to use, make, and share scientific research and results.

## Who Does Open Science?

Open science doesn't only involve researchers; many other stakeholders are affected by the outcomes of open science. Stakeholders include any individuals who can affect or be affected by open science projects.

<SingleFigure size='large' src="./images/clone/Module_1/stakeholders-v2.png"/>

Scientific research should benefit humanity. Although open science has many stakeholders, the advantageous interaction between science and society takes place among three core groups: scientific researchers, policymakers, and the public. Researchers do science and share their results with policymakers and the general public to inform their decisions and improve their lives. The public helps to fund research through taxes and can provide input to future areas of study. Policymakers help to implement measures that are informed by scientific results to improve the health, environment, and livability of society.

These three stakeholder groups remain central to the world of open science. However, open science encourages participation from the broader public. Growth in public participation in science can occur by removing barriers, such as paywalls, and by expanding the community of people who support the scientific research itself.

Here we list some core groups who we envision as taking part in and/or benefitting from open science, while being fully aware that this list is not exhaustive and the categories we choose here have very blurred boundaries.

*Select each tab to get more information.*

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="RESEARCHERS">
        <p>Researchers are often thought of as the ones who do open science to benefit others. However, researchers themselves can also greatly benefit from open science. Their work can achieve higher visibility among colleagues and the public, they receive credit for a full range of activities related to their science (including time spent sharing data and code, for instance), and they have more access to datasets.</p>
        <p>A team of supporters and collaborators enables this research to take place. Open science aims to include these supporting members of the scientific process and ensure they receive credit for their contribution to improve science.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title="POLICYMAKERS">
        <p>Policymakers represent another key community in the science environment. Policymakers can reference scientific findings to inform their decisions for the betterment of society. Those who help in the understanding and dissemination of these policies (including educators and science journalists) are crucial to this process. Policymakers can also play important roles in ensuring and facilitating open science by setting data management processes, encouraging open access legislation, and developing ethical guidelines for experiments. Policymakers can benefit from open science by gaining better access to scientific output via the open sharing of research results.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="three" title="GENERAL PUBLIC">
        <p>The public plays a crucial role in science today as consumers of scientific results who make decisions based on, and adhere to policies shaped by, scientific results. Open science can make scientific results, data, and workflows more openly available to the public by strengthening routes of access to trustworthy sources of information, which in turn increases trust in science. The public can also take part in open science through community science projects, for example, as volunteers to collect or manage data. As a result, participants boost their understanding of science and feel empowered through opportunities to exert influence.</p>
    </Tab>
</CustomTabs>

Open science can strengthen the connection between all of these groups. Communication between researchers and both the public and policymakers stands to drastically improve with more transparent and accessible scientific knowledge.
