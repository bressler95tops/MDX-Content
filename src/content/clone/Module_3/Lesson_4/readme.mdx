# Lesson 4: Sharing Open Data

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn the best practices for sharing your data with a larger audience. When should you share data, and should you share it? You'll have a refresher on the sharing process and how to evaluate if your data is sharable. Next, you will learn how to ensure your data is publicly available through a lesson on repositories and the lifecycle of data accessibility. From selecting a repository to archiving your data, these practices will make sure that your data can be maintained and searchable. Then, you will go over the steps to make your data as reusable as possible, concluding with a section about considering who will help with the data sharing process.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Recognize that institutional variables, issues of security, and timing can ultimately affect your decision to share data.
- Recall the features, inherent responsibilities, funding considerations, and sponsor requirements that researchers should consider when selecting a repository to share data.
- Describe the tools and some best practices that optimize the shareability of data.

## Data Sharing Process Overview

Sharing data is a critical part of increasing the reproducibility of results. Whether it's new data we collect ourselves or data that we process in order to do our analysis, we end up sharing some form of data. We need to think about what data we will share and how to best ensure that it will be open and usable by others.

Data sharing should typically be done through a long-term data center or repository which will be responsible for ingesting, curating, and distributing/publishing your open data. You are responsible for providing information/metadata to help make your data readily discoverable, accessible, and citable. The cost of archiving and publishing data should also be considered.

### So You Want to Share Your Data...

Once you have decided to share your data, there are a number of questions you will have to answer to help you plan and that should be included in your data management plan (DMP), which was also covered in Lesson 3:

        <h3>Who?</h3>
        <p>Roles and responsibilities of the team members in implementing the DMP</p>
    </SliderItem>
</MultiSlider>

In this lesson, we will be covering some steps toward making data. Specifically, we will focus on the "when," "where," "how," and "who" sections of a DMP.

### Open Data Sharing Process

In general, sharing your open data requires the following steps:

1. Make sure your data can be shared.
2. Select or identify a repository to host your data.
3. Work with your repository to follow their process and meet their requirements.
4. Make sure your data is findable and accessible through the repository and that it can be maintained and archived.
5. Request a DOI for your data set so that it is easily citable.
6. Choose a data license.

Sometimes, you may be able to work with a well-staffed repository that will handle many of these steps for you (for instance, if you are working with NASA mission data). Otherwise, it is your responsibility to follow the above steps to share your data openly.

## When and If to Share Data

### When to Share Data?

The decision of when to share should be discussed with everyone on the team and documented in the data management plan. Funding agencies and organizations may have specific requirements about when data must be shared, but here we encourage you to think even earlier than required by your funder about whether it is feasible or possible to share data. There are different times when data could be shared:

<Definitions>
    <Definition title='Advanced Sharing'>
        <p>Sharing at the time of collection or soon after. Some funding agencies require this, or allow for a short 'embargo' period, but a reason (quality checks, calibrations, etc.) is usually required. This maximizes data reuse and impact, which can result in increased collaborations.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Intermediate Sharing'>
        <p>At the time of publication. Many publications (and some funding agencies) require sharing data that is needed to reproduce results at the time of publication.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='Minimum Sharing'>
        <p>End of grant. All scientifically useful data should be shared by the end of the research grant.</p>
    </Definition>
    <Definition title='No Sharing'>
        <p>There are many reasons data should either be restricted or not shared at all.</p>
    </Definition>
</Definitions>

As discussed previously in this curriculum, there are many benefits to sharing as early as possible. Early (advanced) sharing can lead to new and unexpected discoveries and expand your collaboration network. Remember, even when you share data, you are still the world expert on that data! In many cases, when people want to work with the data, they will reach out to you to collaborate.

### Should the Data be Shared?

Before datasets are shared, it's important to consider any restrictions to your ability to share and ensure that your contributors - including sample and data donors - approve its release.

Data should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. Opening our data is a powerful way to enable discovery, transparency, and scientific progress. However, you may want to consider a couple of points before data is shared:

- Some data is subject to laws and regulations which limit the release of the data.
- Your funding agency or your institution may have additional policies and resources - investigate them early and often.

Specific considerations that might prevent the sharing of your data include:

- A country's military secrets or violations of national interests.
- Private medical information or an individual's personal data.
- Cultural/conservation concerns.
- Intellectual property and patents.
- Other - think critically about what you are sharing and the implications of sharing it (for example - do you have permission from everyone involved?)

In the first module of this curriculum, we listed several reasons why certain research products should not be shared. We will review some of these reasons, and go into more detail on a few that are particularly relevant to data.

### Export and Security Considerations

Relevant laws and regulations that may prevent the release of data include but are not limited to:

- [International Traffic in Arms Regulation](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_public_portal_itar_landing) (ITAR), which regulates the manufacture, sale, distribution, and export of defense-related articles and services.
- [Export Administration Regulations](https://www.bis.gov/regulations) (EAR), which regulates the manufacture, sale, distribution, and export of commercial and dual-use items, technology, and information not already covered by ITAR.

    </Definition>
</Definitions>

### Controlled Information Considerations

Some regulations that may prevent the sharing of data include but are not limited to:

- [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html) (HIPAA), which established standards to protect sensitive patient health information from disclosure.
- [Controlled Unclassified Information](https://www.archives.gov/cui) provides standards for handling unclassified information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls consistent with federal laws and regulations.
- Federal laws and regulations governing [classified information](https://www.archives.gov/isoo/faqs) or security requirements.

### Intellectual Property Considerations

Data may be subject to intellectual property, copyright, and licensing concerns. Relevant regulations include patent or intellectual property laws, such as the [Bayh-Dole Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap18.htm), which enables universities, nonprofit research institutions, and small businesses to own, patent, and commercialize inventions developed under federally-funded research programs.

    </Definition>
</Definitions>

Many research institutions have resident experts in intellectual property, copyright, and patent law. They can be a great resource if you have any questions or concerns.

## Where to Share Data

Data can be shared in a variety of locations. While sharing data via email or websites is popular, they are not recommended as they do not meet the requirements for searchability or long-term archival support. Sharing data as part of the supplemental material of a peer-reviewed publication, especially for small datasets, is acceptable in some fields. A long-term repository that provides a permanent identifier is the best option for sharing data.

### Selecting a Data Repository

If you do not already have a data repository in mind, consider the following to narrow down your options:

- Does your funding sponsor require a specific data repository?
- Does your organization/institution recommend a specific data repository?
- Is there a domain-specific repository that is widely used in your research field?
- Does the repository provide open data access?
- Do you think the tools offered by the repository for data discovery and distribution are FAIR and suitable for your data?
- Does the repository require funding from your project? Does it fit within your budget or require sustained support beyond the project life cycle?

Find and compare the services, benefits, and limitations of the repositories you are considering. Each repository will have its own processes and requirements for accepting and hosting your data depending on their level of funding, purpose, and userbase.

Similarly, each repository will provide a different set of functionality and services depending on their level of funding, purpose, and user base.

Data with privacy concerns may have additional anonymization, approval processes, or restrictions on who can access the data.

A good overview of desirable characteristics presented by the White House can be [found here.](https://doi.org/10.5479/10088/113528)

### Ensuring Accessibility

Good repositories will share (or offer) your open data through standard protocols, like HTTPS or SFTP. Common ways to do this are:

- Allowing users the ability to see a list of files that they can click and download via an intuitive interface.
- Creating a documented API for users to generate a list of file links that meet search criteria that they can download in an automated fashion (e.g. machine-to-machine data access).

Additionally, repositories can require authorization and authentication (e.g. logins with usernames/passwords) to access data. While this is allowed under FAIR Principles, it may violate open science principles if not everyone is able to obtain a login.

### Working with a Repository

<CustomTabs>
    <Tab eventKey="one" title="START WORKING WITH A REPOSITORY">
        <p>Repository requirements can vary widely. Always review a repository's requirements to see what actions you need to take once you're ready to start working with them. Also note that some repositories have staff that can help with the process of sharing data, while others rely on the user to know how to share their own data.</p>
        <p>If you use a repository that has staff to help you with the process, they may want to review and comment on your data management plan.</p>
        <p>The repository may request that you provide sample data in order to assess:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>That the data format you intend to use is supported.</li>
            <li>That data variables are named as expected.</li>
            <li>That metadata vocabulary is correct.</li>
            <li>That repository-specific requirements are met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This conformity check can identify misunderstandings early and result in a smooth final submission of your data to the repository.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="two" title="MAINTAINING DATA AT A REPOSITORY">
        <p>As you progress through your project lifecycle, utilize your repository's update, revision, and re-submission processes to keep the archived data products up to date. Any new versions of the data you want to share through the repository will need to go through an assessment similar to the assessment used with your initial data set.</p>
        <p>This means any new version should go through the same DMP review, compliance check, and upload procedure as your initial data set.</p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab eventKey="three" title="ARCHIVING DATA AT A REPOSITORY">
        <p>When your project ends, ensure you've updated and uploaded any companion documentation (discussed in Lesson 3, "Making Open Data") with your final version, even if only a single version of the data was made.</p>
        <p>Make sure the repository will keep your data (or at least your metadata) available for a reasonable period of time after your project ends.</p>
        <p>If any data issues are found after the conclusion of your project, make sure the repository will still accept data revisions, if they are needed.</p>
    </Tab>
</CustomTabs>

## How to Enable Reuse of Data

### Obtaining a DOI

Individuals cannot typically request a digital object identifier (DOI) themselves, but rather have to go through an authorized organization that can submit the request, such as:

- The data repository
- Your organization
- The publisher (if the dataset is part of a publication)

Data makers should provide summary information for DOI landing page(s) if required. Data sharers should accommodate data providers' suggestions and comply with DOI guidelines and create landing page(s). If possible, reserve a DOI ahead of creating your data.

### Ensuring Findability

Repositories handle the sharing, distribution, and curation of data. Additional services they may provide include:

- The assignment of a persistent identifier (like a DOI) to your data set.
- The indexing and/or registration of your data and metadata in various services so that they can be searched and found online (i.e. through search engines).
- Giving feedback to data makers to help them optimize their metadata for findability.
- Coordinating with data makers to ensure metadata refers to the DOI.
- Ensuring the DOI is associated with a landing page with information about your data.

### Making it Easy to Cite Your Data

The goal is to make it easy to cite your data. Best practices include:

- Include a citation statement that lists your DOI.
- Different repositories and journals have different standards for how to cite data. If your repository encourages it, include a .CFF file with your data that explains how to cite your data.
- Clearly identify the data creators and/or their institution in your citation.
  - This allows users to follow up with the creators if they have questions or discover issues.
  - Include ORCID iDs of data authors where possible in the citation.

Now that your data is at a repository and has a citation statement and DOI, publicize it to your users and remind them to cite your data in their work!

## Who is Responsible for Sharing Data?

Sharing data openly is a team effort. An important part of planning for open data is planning and agreeing to roles and responsibilities of who will ensure implementation of the plan.

So what needs to be done? Documenting these roles and responsibilities in your data management plan will help your team stay organized and do science faster! A well-written, detailed plan should address the following questions.

### Who Will Move Data to a Repository?

Once you are ready to send your data to your repository, find the repository's recommendations for uploading data. Determine who will work with your repository to accomplish the following types of activities:

- Provide information on data volume, number of files, and nature (e.g. revised files)
- Check that the file name follows best practices
- Decide how the data will be moved (especially when files are large)
- Check the data! Verify the integrity of the data, metadata, and documentation transfer

### Who Will Develop the Data Documentation and Metadata?

Determine who will work with your repository, inventory the transferred data, metadata, and documentation. This role might include the task of populating any required metadata in databases to make the data findable.

You may be able to accomplish some of these tasks through a repository's interface. However, some types of repositories may require you to interact with their administration teams. For this role, determine who will:

- Provide suggestions to organize data content and logistics
- Develop the metadata
- Develop the documentation (e.g. README file or report)
- Extract metadata from data files, metadata files (if applicable), and documentation to populate the metadata database and request additional metadata as necessary

### Who Will Help With Data Reuse?

Once the repository has made your data available, someone from your team must test access to the data (its accessibility) and distribution methods (its findability). If possible, identify who will work with your repository to optimize/modify tools for intuitive human access and standardize machine access. This role requires someone to:

- Clearly communicate the open protocols needed for the data/metadata.
- Provide actual data use cases to the data publisher to optimize or modify data distribution tools based on available metadata.
- Understand the access protocol(s) and evaluate implications to targeted communities and user communities at large in terms of accessibility.

### Who Will Develop Guidance on Privacy and Sensitivity of Data?

Sharing data should be respectful of the communities that may be involved. This means thinking about privacy issues and cultural sensitivities. Decide who on your team will identify and develop guidance on:

- Privacy concerns and approval processes for release - is the data appropriately anonymized?
- How to engage with communities that data may be about.
- How data can be correctly interpreted.
- Whether any data restrictions are necessary to ensure the sharing is respectful of the community the data involves, such as the collective and individual rights to free, prior, and informed consent in the collection and use of such data, including the development of data policies and protocols for collection.

## Lesson 4: Summary

The following are the key takeaways from this lesson:

- When and if to share data? Determine at what point in a project it makes the most sense to share your data. Remember, not all data can or should be shared.
- Where to share data? Sharing in a public data repository is recommended, and there are many types of repositories to choose from.
- How to enable reuse? Ensure appropriate, community-accepted metadata, assign a DOI, and develop a citation statement to make sure it can be easily found and cited.
- Who helps share data? There are many steps in making and sharing data and it's important to think about who will be responsible for each step.
